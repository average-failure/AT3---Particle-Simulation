There are two ways you can run my program: using a build tool or using the VSCode live server extension.

1. Using a build tool ([Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev))

   1. To run the program you need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (if you don't already have it)
   2. Next, install a build tool, [Vite](https://vitejs.dev), using a terminal in the project folder (so in [this folder](../AT3%20-%20Particle%20Simulation/))

      ```
      npm install --save-dev vite
      ```

   3. After installing Vite, run:

      ```
      npx vite
      ```

   4. If everything went well, something similar to the picture below should appear in your terminal

      ![The text that should show up](./images/image.png)

   5. Now just press 'o' or open <http://localhost:5173/> (or the link shown next to Local)
   6. The simulation should now be open!

2. Using the VSCode [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension
   1. Install the extension through either the link above or from inside VSCode
   2. Open the server by either clicking the 'Go Live' button on the status bar at the bottom of your screen or using the default hotkey ['Alt-L Alt-O'](command:extension.liveServer.goOnline)
   3. A page should open in your default browser. If it doesn't, you can open <http://127.0.0.1:5500/> (which should be the url of the server)
   4. The simulation should now be open!
3. Give me 100% üòè
